# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documentation. The goal is to centralize our processes, templates, and checklists so team members can quickly find guidance for each project phase and keep artifacts up to date.

## Brief overview of OctoAcme project management processes

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first approach. Projects move through these core phases:

1. Initiation
   - Capture the problem, objective, stakeholders, and success metrics in a One-pager.
   - Confirm priority and team availability before approving planning.
   - See: Project Initiation Guide.

2. Planning
   - Turn the approved idea into a prioritized backlog, define scope, estimates, and the Definition of Done.
   - Identify dependencies, risks, and the release/milestone plan.
   - See: Project Planning.

3. Execution & Tracking
   - Deliver in small increments with regular demos and a clear PR workflow.
   - Use the project board to visualize progress and the team cadence (standups, weekly syncs).
   - Track velocity, burndown, and success metrics.
   - See: Execution & Tracking.

4. Release & Deployment
   - Follow pre-release checks (tests, security scans, release notes, rollback plan).
   - Automate deployment where possible and run post-deploy verifications.
   - See: Release & Deployment Guide.

5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
   - Run retrospectives after sprints or releases to capture learnings and create action items.
   - Track improvements in the backlog and measure impact.
   - See: Retrospective & Continuous Improvement.

Cross-cutting responsibilities: Risk management and stakeholder communication are continuous activities â€” capture and monitor risks in the Risk Register and share regular status updates.

## Key roles (at-a-glance)
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, schedule, risk, and communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes and prioritizes the backlog.
- Developers: implement features and tests.
- QA/Testing: validate acceptance criteria.
- Stakeholders: provide approvals and inputs.

More complete persona definitions are in Roles & Personas.
